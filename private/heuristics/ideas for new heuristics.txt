for each tweet classified,
put each n-gram of this tweet in a multi-map of the form:
this n-gram, the category the tweet has been attributed to.

Count a tweet retweeted several times just once

use this map to:
- maybe filter out the terms in newly arrived tweets, leaving only new terms, that are then more likely to provide more info
- check: are these ngrams actually predictive of the category of the tweet?
